2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + X)
3. Search for "Cline"
4. Click "Install" on the official Cline extension

### Option B: Command Line
```bash
code --install-extension saoudrizwan.claude-dev
```

### Option C: VSIX File
1. Download the latest VSIX from [Cline releases](https://github.com/cline/cline/releases)
2. Install via command: `code --install-extension cline-latest.vsix`

## üîë Step 2: Configure API Access

### Anthropic Claude (Recommended)
1. Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to "API Keys"
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

### Alternative Providers
- **OpenRouter**: Great for multiple models ([Get API key](https://openrouter.ai/))
- **OpenAI**: Direct GPT access ([Get API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- **Google AI Studio**: For Gemini models ([Get API key](https://aistudio.google.com/))

### Add API Key to Cline
1. Open VS Code
2. Press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P
3. Type "Cline: Open"
4. Click the settings icon in Cline panel
5. Add your API key and select your model

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Essential Configuration

### Create Your First .clinerules File
```bash
# In your project root
touch .clinerules
```

Add this starter configuration:
```markdown
# Project Configuration for Cline

## Development Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Write tests for business logic
- Use conventional commits (feat/fix/docs/etc.)

## Code Style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing project patterns
- Prioritize readability over cleverness

## Workflow
1. Understand the task completely before starting
2. Plan the implementation approach
3. Write clean, testable code
4. Test the implementation thoroughly
5. Update documentation as needed
```

### Set Up Memory Bank (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
mkdir memory_bank
cd memory_bank
touch project-brief.md tech-stack.md coding-standards.md
```

## üé™ Step 4: Install MCP Servers (Optional)

MCP servers extend Cline's capabilities. Here are the most popular ones:

### GitHub Integration
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

### File System Access
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
```

### Web Search
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
```

### Configure MCP in Cline Settings
Add to your Cline configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/your/projects"]
    }
  }
}
```

## üß™ Step 5: Test Your Setup

### Basic Functionality Test
1. Open any code project in VS Code
2. Open Cline panel (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P ‚Üí "Cline: Open")
3. Try this test prompt:

```markdown
Hello! I want to test our setup. Can you:

1. Tell me what type of project this appears to be
2. List the main files in the root directory
3. Suggest one small improvement we could make

This will help me verify everything is working correctly.
```

### Advanced Feature Test
If you set up MCP servers, try:

```markdown
Can you help me understand this project better by:

1. Using the file system to explore the project structure
2. If this is a Git repository, check the recent commit history
3. Look for any TODO comments or potential improvements

Let's see how our MCP integration is working!
```

## üéØ Step 6: Customize for Your Workflow

### VS Code Settings for Cline
Add these to your VS Code settings.json:
```json
{
  "cline.autoSubmit": false,
  "cline.showLineNumbers": true,
  "cline.wordWrap": true,
  "editor.inlineSuggest.enabled": true,
  "editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions": false
}
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Add these to your keybindings.json:
```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+alt+c",
    "command": "cline.open",
    "when": "!cline.isOpen"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+alt+n", 
    "command": "cline.newTask",
    "when": "cline.isOpen"
  }
]
```

## üöÄ Step 7: Start Your First AI-Powered Project

### Project Initialization Prompt
```markdown
I'm starting a new project and want to set it up with best practices. Here's what I'm building:

**Project**: [Describe your project]
**Technology Stack**: [Your preferred stack]
**Main Features**: [List 3-5 key features]

Can you help me:
1. Set up the initial project structure
2. Configure development tools (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
3. Create a basic README with setup instructions
4. Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline
5. Initialize version control with a good .gitignore

Let's build this the right way from the start!
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Cline Not Responding
1. Check your API key is valid
2. Verify internet connection
3. Restart VS Code
4. Check the Cline output panel for errors

### API Rate Limits
- **Claude**: 50 requests/minute on free tier
- **OpenAI**: Varies by plan
- **Solution**: Upgrade plan or use OpenRouter for better limits

### MCP Server Issues
1. Verify Node.js is installed (v18+)
2. Check MCP server installation: `npm list -g | grep mcp`
3. Verify permissions for file system access
4. Check Cline logs for MCP connection errors

### Performance Issues
- Large files: Use `.clineignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Slow responses: Try a different model or provider
- High token usage: Be more specific in prompts
