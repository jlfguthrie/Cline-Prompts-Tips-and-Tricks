## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### 🧠 Memory Bank Setup

Create a `memory_bank/` folder in your project root:

```
memory_bank/
├── project-brief.md      # Core project description
├── tech-stack.md         # Technologies and preferences
├── coding-standards.md   # Style guides and conventions
├── architecture.md       # System design and patterns
├── workflows.md          # Team processes and procedures
└── context.md           # Current work and priorities
```

#### Example: `memory_bank/project-brief.md`

### ⚙️ Advanced .clinerules Configuration

```markdown
# Advanced Cline Rules for Production Projects

## Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration strictly
- Write tests for all business logic
- Document complex functions with JSDoc
- Use conventional commits (feat/fix/docs/etc.)

## Architecture Patterns
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Separate concerns (data/UI/business logic)
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic

## Performance Guidelines
- Lazy load components and routes
- Optimize images and assets
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor bundle size and Core Web Vitals

## Security Best Practices
- Validate all inputs on client AND server
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Sanitize user-generated content
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## Development Workflow
1. Read existing code to understand patterns
2. Plan implementation before coding
3. Write tests alongside implementation
4. Run linting and type checking
5. Test manually in browser
6. Update documentation as needed

## Common Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run test` - Run all tests
- `npm run lint` - Check code quality
- `npm run type-check` - Verify TypeScript
- `npm run build` - Production build
```

### 🔌 MCP Server Configuration

#### Popular MCP Servers to Install

## 🎪 Community Workflows

### 💡 The "Self-Improving Cline" Workflow
*Contributed by the Cline community*

```markdown
# Self-Improving Cline Setup

Add this to your `.clinerules`:

## Self-Improvement Protocol
At the end of each significant task, ask me:
"Would you like me to update our project documentation or .clinerules based on what we learned?"

This includes:
- New patterns we discovered
- Useful commands we found
- Common issues and their solutions
- Improved workflows or shortcuts

This way, Cline gets better at helping with this specific project over time.
```

### 🔄 The "AI Agent Orchestration" Pattern
*For complex multi-step workflows*

```markdown
# AI Agent Orchestration Prompt

I want to set up a workflow where you:

1. **Planning Agent**: Analyze requirements and create detailed plans
2. **Implementation Agent**: Execute the coding with best practices
3. **Review Agent**: Check code quality and suggest improvements
4. **Testing Agent**: Create and run comprehensive tests

For each role, you should:
- Switch context completely to that perspective
- Use different evaluation criteria
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Hand off cleanly to the next agent

Let's start with the Planning Agent for: [YOUR_TASK]
```

### 🎯 The "Feature Flag" Development Pattern

```markdown
# Feature Flag Development Workflow

When implementing new features:

1. **Always use feature flags** for significant changes
2. **Create two versions**: one with feature on, one off
3. **Write tests for both states**
4. **Document the flag in our feature-flags.md**
5. **Plan the removal strategy upfront**

Example implementation:
```typescript
const isNewFeatureEnabled = process.env.FEATURE_NEW_CHECKOUT === 'true';

if (isNewFeatureEnabled) {
  // New implementation
} else {
  // Existing implementation
}
```

This allows us to:
- Deploy safely without affecting users
- Test in production with limited exposure
- Roll back instantly if issues arise
- Gradually migrate users to new features
```
