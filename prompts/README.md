## 🏆 Most Popular Prompts

### 1. The "Project Onboarding Master"
```markdown
You're joining as my AI pair programmer. First, completely understand this project:

1. **Codebase Analysis**: Read all config files, examine structure, identify patterns
2. **Context Building**: Understand the domain, user needs, and technical goals  
3. **Current State**: What's working, what needs improvement, any obvious issues
4. **Next Steps**: Prioritized recommendations based on your analysis

After your analysis, propose the most impactful task we could tackle together.
```

### 2. The "Feature Implementation Pipeline"
```markdown
I want to implement: [FEATURE_NAME]

Follow our proven 4-phase approach:

**Phase 1 - Planning**
- Requirements analysis and edge case identification
- Technical design and architecture decisions
- Task breakdown and dependency mapping

**Phase 2 - Foundation**
- Data models and API design
- Core business logic implementation
- Error handling and validation

**Phase 3 - Interface**
- UI components and user interactions
- Integration with backend services
- Responsive design and accessibility

**Phase 4 - Quality**
- Comprehensive testing (unit + integration)
- Performance optimization
- Documentation and deployment prep

Ready to start? Describe the feature and I'll begin with Phase 1.
```

### 3. The "Debug Detective"
```markdown
I have a bug: [DESCRIBE_ISSUE]

Be my debugging partner with this systematic approach:

1. **Evidence Gathering**
   - Reproduce the issue with minimal steps
   - Collect error messages, logs, and stack traces
   - Check recent changes and potential correlations

2. **Hypothesis Generation**
   - List 3-5 potential root causes
   - Rank by probability and impact
   - Consider both obvious and subtle possibilities

3. **Systematic Testing**
   - Test each hypothesis with targeted experiments
   - Use binary search to isolate the problem
   - Document findings as we go

4. **Solution & Prevention**
   - Implement the fix with proper testing
   - Add safeguards to prevent recurrence
   - Update documentation/comments as needed

Let's solve this together!
